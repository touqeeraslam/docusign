### BREAKING
- The SDK now supports the**Full and latest DocuSign API support**(17.1.00.00). NO MORE OMITTED ENDPOINTS.
- **Getter and setter methods of all models' fields were removed.** Direct access to models' fields is now required. See the code snippet in README.md and test/SdkUnitTests.js for example.
- Added optional `opts` to several methods across different APIs. Old client code might need to be updated prior to using 3.0.0 and above.
- Methods that accept optional parameters, defined as `opts`, now accept plain javascript objects only. For instance AuthenticationApi.login({'api_password': true}) will return a fake password that can be used in subsequent API calls instead of the original password.
